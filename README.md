## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using binary classification techniques. By analyzing customer data, we aim to identify patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** [bank.csv](./bank.csv)
- **Description:** The dataset contains various features related to customer demographics and banking activities.

---

## 📊 Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of various binary classification algorithms to predict customer churn.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
